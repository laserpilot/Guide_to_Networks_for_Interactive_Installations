Guide to Network Best Practices for Interactive Installations

Note: Currently This writeup is just a WIP. I'm going to stub out some important bullet points for now and add things when I can.

I'm by no means a network expert, but recognize the need for a writeup like this to help other folks getting into this field. I'd like to keep these explanations fairly general, straightforward and easy to read. For some topics, it might be better to link out to another deep dive article instead of re-hashing.

That said, if you have ideas or want to contribute - please fork and submit a pull request!
